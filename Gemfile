# You may have noticed that we recieved a failed 422 Unprocessable Entity 
# response from Rails. This is because Rails has csrf protection enabled 
# by default, and Angular isn't sending the token to Rails when we're 
# trying to add a post. Thankfully $http supports sending csrf tokens out 
# of the box as a X-XSRF-TOKEN header, as long as it detects a XSRF-TOKEN 
# cookie with a token in it. There's also happens to be a gem called 
# angular_rails_csrf which we'll add to our project which will have 
# Rails automatically send the cookie to Angular and also validate the 
# header when Angular is submitting data, that way all we need to do is 
# 	drop in the gem and everything should just work
